AffiliateWP - Add Referral Links
========================

Append an affiliate's referral ID to outbound links on external landing pages.

Like other affiliate plugins, AffiliateWP must be installed on the same domain as your ecommerce system (Easy Digital Downloads, WooCommerce etc). Affiliates would then promote your URL and be awarded commission when a customer purchases. This plugin is intended for situations where you might have a landing page on an external domain. Affiliates will now be able to promote these landing page URLs as well, and will still be awarded commission if the customer clicks through to your ecommerce store and purchases. It does this by storing the affiliate's ID into a cookie and passing this ID to any outbound links to your ecommerce store. Even if the affiliate moves between pages their ID will still be properly tracked.
